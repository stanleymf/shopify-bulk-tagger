## [1.14.6] - 2025-01-16

### Critical Fix: Switched to Customer Search API
- **BREAKING**: Replaced direct segment access with Shopify Customer Search API for compatibility
- **Root Issue**: Your Shopify API doesn't support `customerSegment` field - eliminated GraphQL segment queries entirely
- **New Approach**: `getSegmentCustomerIds()` now uses customer search with segment query translation
- **Query Translation**: Smart conversion of segment syntax to search syntax:
  - `amount_spent >= 240` ‚Üí `total_spent:>=240`
  - `sms_subscription_status = 'SUBSCRIBED'` ‚Üí `accepts_marketing:true`
  - `email_subscription_status = 'SUBSCRIBED'` ‚Üí `accepts_marketing:true`
  - Preserves AND/OR operators for complex queries
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all Shopify stores regardless of GraphQL API limitations
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added step-by-step query conversion and customer search logging
- **Performance**: Direct customer search avoids segment API limitations and failures
- **Result**: Segments with properly translatable queries will now find and tag actual customers

### Technical Details
- Replaced `translateSegmentQueryToCustomerSearch()` method with `convertSegmentQueryToSearchQuery()`
- Updated `bulkAddTagsToSegmentGraphQL()` and `bulkRemoveTagsFromSegmentGraphQL()` to use search approach
- Removed all segment direct access attempts and fallback logic
- Enhanced error handling for unsupported query patterns

### Deployment
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully deployed to [https://bulk-tagger.stanleytan92.workers.dev](https://bulk-tagger.stanleytan92.workers.dev)
- **Version ID**: e1ca4670-8bed-47f9-ae7b-19bf47bb940a
- **Deployment Time**: 2025-01-16 11:42 UTC
- **Build Size**: 81.15 KiB (15.57 KiB gzipped)
- **Assets**: 5 files total (2 new, 3 cached)

## [1.14.5] - 2025-01-16

### Changed
- **Simplified Segment Access**: Removed complex query translation and fallback logic for customer segment access
- **Direct Access Only**: Now only uses direct GraphQL segment access to get customer IDs, no search fallbacks
- **No Query Translation**: Eliminated the complex segment query to customer search translation that was causing issues

### Technical Details
- Removed `translateSegmentQueryToCustomerSearch` fallback logic from `getSegmentCustomerIds`
- Simplified approach: if direct segment access works, tag those customers; if not, show clear error
- No more complex query parsing or customer search fallbacks that could introduce inconsistencies

### User Impact
- More predictable behavior: what you see in the segment is what gets tagged
- Clearer error messages when segment access fails
- Eliminates confusion from query translation mismatches

## [1.14.4] - 2025-01-16

- Fixed progress calculation to prevent counters from exceeding total customer count
- Enhanced progress tracking safety with bounds checking to avoid display anomalies
- Fixed segment count discrepancy handling to always use actual processable customer count for accurate progress

### Technical Details
- Added safe progress bounds checking in `updateJobProgress` to cap current at total
- Modified total progress calculation to use actual customer IDs count instead of segment metadata count
- Improved progress tracking reliability for consistent user experience

## [1.14.2] - 2025-01-16

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: GraphQL customer ID format issue causing "Variable $id of type ID! was provided invalid value" errors
- Fixed customer ID format conversion in `getSegmentCustomerIds` fallback search to return proper GID format
- Added `ensureCustomerGID` utility function to guarantee correct customer ID format for GraphQL operations
- Fixed customer ID format in `batchAddTags` and `batchRemoveTags` methods for both customer queries and mutations
- All bulk tagging operations now use proper `gid://shopify/Customer/XXXXX` format instead of raw numeric IDs

### Technical Details
- Added comprehensive customer ID validation to prevent GraphQL type errors
- Enhanced fallback search mechanism to return GID-formatted customer IDs
- Fixed format consistency between direct segment access and search fallback methods
