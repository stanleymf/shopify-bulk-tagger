### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A Shopify store with API access
- Shopify Private App credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Bulk-Tagger
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Shopify Setup

1. **Create a Private App**:
   - Go to your Shopify Admin ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Manage private apps
   - Create a new private app
   - Enable the following API scopes:
     - `read_customers`

     - `read_customer_segments`

2. **Get Your Credentials**:
   - Copy your API key, API secret, and access token
   - Note your shop domain (e.g., `your-store.myshopify.com`)

3. **Configure the App**:
   - Open the app and go to Settings
   - Enter your shop domain, API key, API secret, and access token
   - Click "Connect Store" to test the connection
   - Once connected, click "Sync Segments" to fetch your customer segments

## Usage

### Connecting Your Store
1. Navigate to the Settings page
2. Enter your Shopify store credentials
3. Click "Test Connection" to verify your credentials
4. Click "Connect Store" to establish the connection
5. Click "Sync Segments" to fetch your customer segments

### Managing Customer Segments
- View all customer segments on the Dashboard
- See real-time customer counts and segment details
- Sync segments manually or automatically
- Monitor last sync timestamps

### Creating Tagging Rules
- Navigate to the Rules page
- Create rules based on customer segment membership
- Define tag actions (add/remove tags)
- Activate/deactivate rules as needed

## Data Persistence Details

### Storage Structure
The app uses localStorage with the following structure:

```javascript
// Main app data
bulk_tagger_data: {
  segments: [], // Customer segments from Shopify
  rules: [],    // Tagging rules
  lastSync: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}

// Shopify configuration
bulk_tagger_shopify_config: {
  shopDomain: "your-store.myshopify.com",
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  apiSecret: "your-api-secret", 
  accessToken: "your-access-token",
  isConnected: true,
  lastSync: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Persistence Features
- **Automatic Saving**: All changes are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of storage errors with fallbacks
- **Data Validation**: Input validation before saving to storage
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data is stored securely in browser storage

## API Integration

### Shopify API Endpoints Used
- `GET /admin/api/2024-01/shop.json` - Test connection
- `GET /admin/api/2024-01/customer_segments.json` - Fetch customer segments
- `GET /admin/api/2024-01/customer_segments/{id}/customers.json` - Get segment customers
- `PUT /admin/api/2024-01/customers/{id}.json` - Update customer tags
- `GET /admin/api/2024-01/customers/search.json` - Search customers

### Error Handling
- **Authentication Errors**: Automatic detection and user-friendly messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting with exponential backoff
- **Network Errors**: Comprehensive network error handling
- **API Errors**: Detailed error messages for different HTTP status codes

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
1. **Invalid Credentials**: Verify your API key, secret, and access token
2. **CORS Errors**: Ensure your shop domain is correct and includes `.myshopify.com`
3. **Permission Errors**: Check that your private app has the required API scopes
4. **Network Issues**: Verify your internet connection and try again

### Data Sync Issues
1. **No Segments Found**: Ensure your store has customer segments created
2. **Sync Failures**: Check your API credentials and try reconnecting
3. **Stale Data**: Use the "Sync Segments" button to fetch fresh data

### Storage Issues
1. **Data Not Persisting**: Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
2. **Storage Quota**: Clear browser data if you encounter storage quota errors
3. **Corrupted Data**: Use the "Disconnect Store" button to reset configuration

## Security Considerations

- **API Credentials**: Stored securely in browser localStorage
- **No Server Storage**: All data is stored locally in the browser
- **HTTPS Required**: App should be served over HTTPS in production
- **Credential Validation**: All API credentials are validated before use

## üîß Shopify Integration

### Required API Scopes
- `read_customers` - Access customer data
- `read_customer_segments` - Access segment information
- `write_customers` - Update customer tags

### Authentication Flow
1. User initiates Shopify store connection
2. Redirect to Shopify OAuth authorization
3. Store access token securely
4. Initialize API service with shop domain and token

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /admin/api/2024-01/customer_segments.json` - Fetch segments
- `GET /admin/api/2024-01/customer_segments/{id}/customers.json` - Get segment customers
- `PUT /admin/api/2024-01/customers/{id}.json` - Update customer tags

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Setting Up Your First Rule

1. **Connect Your Store**
   - Click "Connect Store" in the dashboard
   - Authorize the app in Shopify
   - Wait for initial segment sync

2. **Create a Tagging Rule**
   - Navigate to the "Rules" section
   - Click "Create Rule"
   - Define trigger segment and actions
   - Save and activate the rule

3. **Monitor Execution**
   - View rule execution status
   - Check customer update counts
   - Review any errors or issues

### Rule Configuration

Rules follow this pattern:
```
WHEN a customer is a member of [Segment Name]
THEN [Add/Remove] tag [Tag Name]
```

**Example Rule:**
- **Trigger**: VIP Customers segment
- **Actions**: 
  - Add tag "VIP"
  - Remove tag "New Customer"
